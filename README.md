Introduction
===================================

The goal of the assignment is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
